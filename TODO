* Support duplicate appids (Dishonored is a great example here)
* Support %d mapping with an offset to further reduce cruft (Dishonored)
* Support ‘Trophy Packs’ / Steam DLC mapping (Borderlands 2)
* Support named trophies, like we get back from Sony’s backend, making the mapping more robust
* Support games without trophies or achievements, as we only track explicit, implicit and unknown mappings, not NO mappings.
