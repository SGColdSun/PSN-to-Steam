* Support ‘Trophy Packs’ / Steam DLC mapping (Borderlands 2, PAYDAY, Skyrim)
* Support named trophies, like we get back from Sony’s backend, making the mapping more robust
* Support offset mappings for titles like Dishonoured and GTA V where they are zero-indexed on Steam
* Support default mapping/offsets with additional overrides for the cases like GTA V where it is a linear mapping but for one trophy (it seems on their back-end, ACH50 is flagged for the platinum?) like ACH51
